# Local Hosting - SpringBoot
- How to get started and add stuff using Spring Initialzr
    - Will include the Spring Web and Spring Data JPA additions
    - This will include talking about Docker and using that
- Spring decorators and what they do/allow Spring to infer
- General flow of information - lots of it is automated!
    - Entry point
    - Ping controller with GET and POST very briefly
    - _(Maybe seeing what this all looks like without Initialzer?)_
    - Brief mention to the Maven wrapper as well possibly
- Talk about how a database is integrated to the project and how that works
    - Also discuss what Data JPA does for you already, such as protecting against SQL Injection
- Throughout the lecture or in this moment of time, talk about spring-boot:run and accessing your exposed localhost port from browser
- Any other important considerations can be added/changed/removed here!
